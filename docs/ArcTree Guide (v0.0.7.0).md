**ArcTree Official Guide (Work In Progress):**
> *__Stage 1: Before Eternal Core:__*

Beginning of the game. You will have Memory layer first and Light/Dark layers second. All three layers have 12 upgrades, but not all of these upgrade have positive effects. The 11th and 12th upgrades of Memory layer (_Directly Transfer_ and _Conclusion_, M33&M34) have negative nerfs to Fragments and Memories gain, but you have to go buy them to unlock L&D layer.

Once you have bought the 12th upgrades of Memory layer ( _Conclusion_, M34), you will be able to unlock one of two new layers. Each of them is fine, you will unlock another not far away. Light Tachyons boost Fragments generation while Dark Matters boost Memories gain. **The two new layers will be hidden after their reset until the 12th upgrades of Memory layer re-bought and that's intended game design.** That means you cannot buy upgrades and/or regain points immediately after reset.

At this stage, you are likely to gain two kinds of points alternatively, but soon you will find out Light Tachyons gains much faster than Dark Matters. At the first half of L&D layer, if you are stuck at getting one upgrade, go to get more upgrades from the opposite layer. This may happen when you are trying to get the 6th upgrade of Dark layer (_More Darkness_, D22).

Gain much more points before going to buy an upgrade is highly recommended. Because the two layers will be hidden, you progress speed will be very slow if you don't have enough Light Tachyons/Dark Matters stored. Keep pushing until you unlock the 7th upgrade of Dark layer ( _Force Operation_, D23), which needs the 5th upgrade of Light layer (_Seeking Delight._, L21). D23 can force you have M34 upgrade, meaning the two layer no longer hidden but the M34 nerfs also exists. **Gain much more points before buying D23 is strongly recommended,** as you are experiencing M34 nerfs.

After you have bought D23, the game is a little tricky. If you want to earn Light Tachyons this reset, you need to buy M33 to get the Memories gain boost. If you want Dark Matters, you shouldn't buy M33 since it has a Fragments generation speed decrease.

Keep pushing. This stage is grindy and slow. Don't forget to do achievements which have good rewards. Once you bought the last upgrade of both two layers (_The Light_ and _The Dark_, L34&D34), you will see _Eternal Core_ (M41) in Memory layer. That's the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 2: Between Eternal Core and R&F layers:__*

After you bought _Eternal Core_ (M41), the game resets with two new layers shown, but you have to play the whole stage 1 again. This part will be much faster since you have enough achievements and L&D milestones have been unlocked. The second row of achievements will remove M34's nerfs. Keep moving and you will unlock R&F layers quickly.

> *__Stage 3: R&F layers:__*

Red and Forgotten layers are the next layers you are going for. Red layer has several _Happiness Challenges_ (Hc1~Hc9), while Forgotten layer has _Scythe_ and _Beacon_ mechanics. _Happiness Challenges_ are challenges having both positive and negative effects, while _Beacons_ are upgrades beginning from middle, revealed by neighbor upgrades and limited by _Scythes_.

When you first reach these layers, you can choose one of them. Their mechanics are unlocked by the final milestone and you will unlock both of two layer when reaching milestones, so each of them is fine.

 When choosing _Beacons_, keep in mind that there's no point you could be totally stuck. However, among the first eight beacons, _Delightful Memories_ (F22) can boost your progress directly; _Dark Memories_ (F44) can accelerate memories; _Forgotten Memories_ (F42) can let you gain more Forgotten Drops, turning into more _Scythes_ and _Beacons_. Buying them first will make you progress faster. Among the second sixteen beacons, the same strategy still exists. Light-related beacons boost Fragments, Dark-related beacons boost Memories and Forgotten-related beacons boost Forgotten Drops itself. Red-related beacons are not recommended, since Red Dolls' effect is small at this stage.

 What you are going to do here is simple: Do _Happiness Challenges_, buy more _Scythes_ and _Beacons_. Trying to use _Happiness Challenges_' positive effects to farm is useless because things will be reset when quitting Hc. If you are stuck at one Hc, try to change _Beacons_.

 At this stage, the 18th achievement (_Force Balance_, a43) is the most challenging thing you need to do. Guide suggestion is to finish this achievement in Rc2 (_Cracking Softcap_), and turn Light Tachyons autobuyer off if you have. Reset L layer manually for about 3 to 5 times which you may get thousands of Light Tachyons, and hold D hotkey. You may need to try 2 or 3 times if you are unlucky, but you must get this achievement otherwise you cannot push forward without its reward.

 After you finished Rc9 (_Red Comet_), _The Lab_ (M42) will appear in Memory layer. That's the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 4: Lab Part 1-Setup:__*

Lab layer is the first layer of physics route. This layer will never be reset and will be active during the whole game. The first part of Lab layer-Setup upgrades is a tutorial of Lab layer, unlocking its mechanics.

_Researches_ subtab means Lab upgrades. Most of them are powerful and/or QoL like. Setup upgrades will unlock other Lab mechanics.

_Research Progress_ subtab is the achievements in Lab layers. Although there are some rewards, most progress is story-related and has no boosts.You don't need to do them intentionally.

_Research Transformers_ subtab will unlock lots of buyables. This is the main mechanic of Lab layer. You could gain more Research Points and accelerate Research Power generation. At this stage, you are looking for their Research Points reward, since you have few points.

_Milestones_ subtab are milestones which will unlock the effects of transformers, making transformers more useful.

What you need to do at this stage is quite simple: Buy upgrades and transformers, and unlock _Anonymous Effects_ (LAu51).

> *__Stage 5: LC&FL layers and Lab Part 2-Anonymous Researches:__*

Luminous Church layer & Flourish Labyrinth layers are the next main layers of the game. But at this stage, LC&FL layers have no boosts to your progress except some QoL milestones. What you need to focus is still Lab layer. The second part of Lab layer-Anonymous Researches make R&F layer automatic gradually and boost your lab progress greatly. Keep buying upgrades and transformers. Don't forget to get some Luminous Churchs and Flourish Labyrinths. You will finally unlock _The World_ (LAu101), which is the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 6: LC&FL layers, World layer and Lab Part 3-World Researches:__*

World layer is the first layer of mechanic route. This route is designed to restore the original mechanics in original Arcaea game. World layer itself is an idle layer. The progress bar will move at a slow speed and you will gain a World Step if the progress bar is full. The first row of World upgrades will let you cost LC&FL you already gained and you could reach the 4th milestone of both LC&FL, unlocking their mechanics.

LC layer's mechanic is _Zero Sky_. It is a endless challenge where you can gan Glowing Roses. Glowing Roses boost nothing at first, but after you get 100 roses the 30th achievement (_The True Presbyter in The World_, a65) will make Roses boost World Step gain speed. Entering and Exiting _Zero Sky_ will force an LC reset and Roses will reset to zero (or reset half after you get the 35th achievement, _Anthemy_, a75) when you enter, so you need to idle for a long time in _Zero Sky_ if you want more Glowing Roses.

FL layer's mechanic is _Maze_. You will choose one of directions in Maze. Each of four directions has a effect. You cannot choose since Maze gives you only one option at first. But after the 33rd achievement (_Nothing Can Stop Us!_, a73) you will have more options and there's strategy. Moving west is useful only when you want to get more Glowing Roses. Moving north is almost useless at this stage, since it cannot reduce the requirement of gaining LC&FL that much. Moving east itself looks useless, but it is worthable. You can use _Mental Breakdown_ to reset Maze, so that you could use different Maze strategies.

The 9th upgrade of World layer (_Restriction with Possibilities_, W31) will unlock three new types of World Steps. Random Steps means gaining this step will be faster at a random magnification; Fixed Steps means gaining this step will be slower but boosting LC&FL gain permanently after you get through. Restricted Steps is a small challenge, which have rewards boosting Research Points gain. Random and Fixed Steps' probability is 7%, while Restricted Steps' is 1%, so you may idle for a long time to meet them if you are very unlucky.

The _Fall Down_ button in World layer is designed for those who will enduring an extreme long Restricted Step or has too few Fixed Steps and Restricted Steps. Because the Step Height is based on you current World Steps, having less Steps will make you gain new Steps faster. _Fall Down_ won't decrease Fixed Steps and Restricted Steps you have already passed through.

After unlocking all mechanics of these three layers, keep buying upgrades in Lab. Finally, you will _Celebrate Anniversary_ (LAu151), which is the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 7: Between Story layer unlocked and G&K layers:__*

_Celebrate Anniversary_ (LAu151) will unlock Story layer, which reveals the plot of ArcTree game. Story layer itself is simple: you will read stories and each story will return an upgrade. Story upgrades are powerful usually.

Keep reading stories until the 8th upgrade of Story layer (_Exploration_, S23), which will enable you to unlock two new layers: Gemini layer and Knife layer.

> *__Stage 8: G&K layers before Lab Part 4-Fragmental Researches:__*

At the beginning of this stage, you have to choose one of Gemini or Knife layers to unlock. Although their effects have little difference, **unlock Gemini layer first is highly recommended**, because six thousands of World Steps need a lot of time.

Gemini layer has _Gemini Tower_ mechanic. It is same with Balance layer from Prestige Tree. You should set max speed of one progress bar and change to another frequently, so that you could gian Star Point and Moon Point very quickly.

Knife layer has _Memory Adjustment_ mechanic, which are challenges with repetitions. Keep in your mind that _Searching For Essence_ (Kc3), _Rationalism_ (Kc4) and _Otherside of Godess_ (Kc7) are very difficult. You will not finish all five times of them at the end of this stage. _Overhandling Rift_ (Kc6) is the most strategic Kc. Use Beacons related to Light Tachyons/Forgotten Drops, and use Beacons related to Dark Matters if you still can build more Beacons.

Keep pushing _Gemini Tower_ and _Memory Adjustment_ challenges, so that you could meet requirement of new Story updates. Before you reach _Rediscover Fragments_ (S33), you should have already bought all Gemini upgrades and have finished all Kc except Kc3x5, Kc4x5 and Kc7x5.

> *__Stage 9: G&K layers during Lab Part 4-Fragmental Researches:__*

_Rediscover Fragments_ (S33) will unlock the forth part of Lab layer-Fragmental Researches, bringing you back to the Lab. There are new powerful upgrades, enabling you to pass the last Kc.

What you need to do here is simple: buy upgrades. After you have bought all 17 new Fragmental Researches and two new Story upgrades, you will unlock Institution layer. That's the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 10: Institution layer:__*

Things become very crazy in Institution layer. In this layer, you main goal is to get more Institution Funds, so you need to gain more Research Power. At first you only have England site. It's passive but powerful, which you would like to use it in the entire stage. After you unlocked Western European sites, Germany site is recommended because it can boost Research Power greatly and it can be boosted by Poland site. Norway is the thing you will like after unlocking Eastern European sites, but it needs active gaming and quick operation. Before you get the 6th milestone of Institution layer, the strategy below is recommended: 
1. Upgrade your England site as possible as you can.
2. Upgrade Germany second and Poland third.
3. When you almost reach the next Funds, degrade your sites and upgrade Norway as quick as possible.

When you unlocked Asian and American sites, things become more crazy. China site is very strong at Memory & Fragments generation, while USA site is **ultra** strong on everything else. Egypt site itself has a weak effect but USA could boost it to 30x. At this stage, the strategy below is recommended:
* Setup
    1. Upgrade Egypt site as far as you can and upgrade USA site after that.
    2. Gradually switch the grades of Egypt site and USA site.
    3. Degrade all and Upgrade China site as far as you can, then Upgrade USA site second.
    4. Idle for a few seconds.
* Progressing
    1. Degrade all, and upgrade England as far as you can. 
    2. Upgrade Germany site second, Poland third. (If you can't push much Research Power when "England first", try "Germany-Poland combination first" strategy instead.)
    3. Idle for gaining Research Power.
    4. When you **almost** get the next Funds, degrade some and upgrade Norway as fast as you can to get more Institution Funds.

With this strategy, it should be easy for you to get _Efficient Line_ (S41). The next timewall update is _Self Breakthrough_ (S44). Try France site since France can boost Research Point (but not Power) gain. Once you get _Awaken_ (S45) Upgrade, you unlock Awake layer and that's the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 11: Awake layer Stage 1-L&D Awake:__*

Like Master layer in PT, Awake layer will let you replay old layers and amplify old layers. The first two awake-able layers are Light and Dark layers. Both of them are fine, but awaking Light layer first is easier because you could keep more Memory upgrades.

After awaken two layers, both layers will unlock four new upgrades, eight in total. All these upgrades needs a challenging requirement. China, France, Germany and Isreal sites will help. It is designed that the 1st upgrades of 4th row on both L&D side are the hardest ones to get, so try to get other new upgrades first.

After you bought all new upgrades, you will be able to get the third Awaken Core and that's the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 12: Awake layer Stage 2-R&F Awake:__*

From this stage, you will have to choose which layer to awake first, since different layer has different mechanics now and their awaking difficulty curves are different. This guide will split into three paragraphs in each stage, guiding the playing process of awaking each layer first, and the process after awaking both of two layers.
### 12.1 Awake Red layer first
Awaking Red layer first is **NOT** recommended, since this process has the lowest fault tolerance of whole AW mechanic. If you choose to awake R first, you need to farm enough Institution Funds and enough Research Transformers. They won't do much help, but it will be even harder without them.

Before entering R awaking, you should degrade all useless Institution sites, including France(due to its nerf to Germany), Norway and Australia(because you won't farm funds in awaking), Egypt(since LC&FL are deactivated), Russia(useless all the time). You also need to degrade China and Isreal temporarily since it will affect USA, however you must use China and Isreal to reach challenge goals.

Awaking Red layer needs very active playing. As soon as you enter R awaking, do Red reset twice immediately. You **MUST** get at least 261 red dolls after doing Red reset twice. If not, you have zero possibility to awake R successfully and you have to redo awaking from beginning.

If you have at least 261 red dolls, you could do Rc1 and Rc2 (_Broken Toyhouse_ and _Cracking Softcap_) in awaking process. The key to awake Red layer successfully is to gain enough Red Dolls **IN** Rc3 (_Naughty Bugs_) instead of completing Rc3. Rc3 can only be completed once and cannot be entered after completion, so do not misoperate to complete Rc3. You have zero possibility to reach 276 dolls goal outside of Rc3.

After awaking Red layer, a new bunch of challenges called _Celebration Ends_ will be unlocked. All of them are a little hard, but you could complete them if your sites have proper set and you idle for sometime in these challenges. These challenges will boost your progress, especially LA & I. However doing an I reset will reset all _Celebration Ends_ challenges except Rc12 (_Happy Reality_), so you'd better farm Funds before doing _Celebration Ends_ or after completing Rc13 (_Crazy Lab_).

After completing Rc14 (_Gods Concern_), you will have the ability to reach 4th Core by using USA/Egypt/Isreal/China properly. With the help of awaken Red layer, awaking Forgotten layer would be very easy.
### 12.2 Awake Forgotten layer first
Awaking Forgotten layer first may be very annoying since the autobuyer of Light Tychyons has already been forced on. This means you will face the flashing reset button of Forgotten layer and you have to try to reset F layer when you could get more Drops. It should be a relief that Awaking Forgotten layer has high fault tolerance. It shouldn't be a problem if you set your site correctly: degrade France, Norway, Australia, Egypt and Russia. Isreal and China are open.

After entering F awaking, do some F reset and then get _Memorize_ (F33), then set _Forgotten Memories_ (F42) as your priority. F42, F22 and F44 are the first bunch of beacons you could buy, then three color beacons at the corner. From now on the remaining processes of F awaking should be very easy. If you can't reset F layer at when you want, you could just wait for a while so that L layer won't reset that often. After you bought all 15 beacons not related to Red Dolls, you will be able to get e800 Drops and awake Forgotten layer.

Awaking Forgotten layer will unlock 25 new _Hyper Beacons_, which related to K, G, LC and FL layers. Since your next goal is to get more memories, _Hyper Beacons_ related to K is what you want right now. After bought 3 to 5 _Hyper Beacons_, you should be able to get 4th Core and that's quite easy for you to awake Red layer.
### 12.3 Before 5th Core
After awaking both R&F layers, remember to complete all Challenges again since they were reset. With the help of awaken Red layer, you could buy the outermost sixteen _Hyper Beacons_ easily. You will hit a building limit on 16, just as what you had met when you first play Forgotten layer. At this time Rc17 (_Hyper Forgotten_) will be unlocked to break this limit. It's like a lottery. You could complete it with the help of Isreal & China or just click again and again until it chooses _Memorize_ (F33) in normal Beacons.

After you complete all _Celebration Ends_ challenges, you will have the ability to buy the inner 9 _Hyper Beacons_. If you can't afford the LC/FL cost, use USA & Egypt combo. On the otherside, if you do not have enough K/F, remember to use Isreal & China to get massive Memories and Fragments.

Remember at this stage, I reset will reset _Celebration Ends_ and _Hyper Beacons_, but it will be easy for you to complete them back. After completing all _Celebration Ends_ challenges and buying all _Hyper Beacons_, you could gain more than 25k Institution Funds. With the boost of Isreal & China, you could reach the 5th Core and that's the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 13: Awake layer Stage 3-LC&FL Awake:__*

Awaking Luminous layer or Flourish layer themselves is a piece of cake, what will really shock you is the new layers unlocked after awaking them: Genesis layer (GE) and Forbearance layer (FO).
### 13.1 Awake Luminous layer first
Before entering Luminous layer awaking, open all sites except France and Russia. Do **NOT** reset LC, do four _Celebration Ends_ challenges first. Rc12 (_Happy Reality_) will reset your sites but that's fine. The key to awake LC successfully is to open **France** to max level before your first LC reset. With the help of France site and Isreal/China off, you should gain 11k Luminous Churches when 1st reset.

LC reset will reset _Celebration Ends_ challenges, but you don't need them any more. Enter _Zero Sky_ to gain Glowing Roses and buffs. With the help of USA/Egypt and Roses, you will gain the remain Luminous Churches and awake LC layer.

Awaking LC will display the next new layer of light route: Genesis layer (GE), but you still need 5e630 Roses to unlock it. France site is the only way to reach this goal.

Genesis layer has a whole equipment system, inspiration comes from the game _Dicey Dungeons_. In this layer, you will gain Element Essences automaticly as money to buy or upgrade your equipment. You could buy equipment in Shop, upgrade them in BlackSmith, check or scrap them in Inventory, and finally equip them in Equipment slot. Each equipment has different effect, shape and price.

When you first unlock GE layer, your Equipment slot is only 2x2, which is small. To reach 6th Core's goal (which is e7400 Memories), the equipment you're focusing is _Genesis Overload_ which can push Memory softcap 1e100 later violently. This equipment is very expensive, around 150 Element Essences, so you need to buy other equipments and scrap them when you need to buy one _Genesis Overload_. Besides, _Compute Matrix_ and its upgraded version are very useful on LA/I farming, while _Enjoyment Puzzle+_ can be used to fill vacancy.

With the help of _Genesis Overload_ and Isreal/China, you could gain 6th Core and begin to awake Flourish layer. With the help of LC layer you will awake Flourish layer once you entering it, unless you open USA/Egypt and Isreal/China at the same time.
### 13.2 Awake Flourish layer first
Just don't open China/Isreal while USA/Egypt is open and you will pass the easiest awaking process of the game. Do FL reset twice and you should success. However, you will endure a much harder challenge after awaking FL layer.

Awaking FL will display the next new layer of dark route: Forbearance layer (FO), but you still need 3e100 Times Moved in Maze to unlock it. This won't be hard if you idle without China/Isreal for a while.

Forbearance layer has a new challenge in it: _Overwhelming Growth_. This challenge has a completion limit, which equals to the number of Forbearance Endurances. 

Eyes of the Storm is another currency of FO layer. It can be gained by completing milestone and completing _Overwhelming Growth_ challenge. By using Eyes of the Storm, you could activate Storm effects. FO11 will help you to finish _Overwhelming Growth_ challenge, FO12 could help you to get more FO while FO13 helps you push main progress.

When you gain the 4th Eyes of the Storm, you could switch FO11 to FO22, which will help you push Memories. The ideal situation to gain next Core is that you have 3FO and FO11, FO12, FO13, FO22 on. Of course you may gain it even if you have only 2FO by idle. With the help of FL layer, there's no barrier you will meet when awaking LC.
### 13.3 Before 7th Core-Institution Upgrades
After your completion of both awaking LC&FL layers, it seems that you can't reach 7th Core even with _Genesis Overload_ and Isreal/China. So this stage you should switch your task to the next story upgrade: _Instruction Construction_ (S52), which will unlock Institution Upgrades.

Institution Upgrades is an upgrade tree. You cannot buy them all at a time, so you need to respec them frequently in different situations. When Respecing Upgrades, Site levels exceeding its max won't be respeced to its max, so upgrades like _Euratom_ (I33) can be bought only once to gain its effect.

The first Institution Upgrades _Nature Paper_ (I11) will boost Lab layer massively, and that should be enough. You could gain the 7th Core around 8GE & 2FO, 9GE & 3FO if played well. That's the end of this stage.

> *__Stage 14: Awake layer Stage 4-G&K Awake:__*

Which one would you like? Two pumps which may destroy your mouse or another Pair Challenge just like _NG+3_?
### 14.1 Awake Gemini layer first
Before entering Gemini layer awaking, open all sites except France/Russia permanently, China/Isreal temporarily.

After entering Gemini awake, **DO NOT TOUCH FL**, they will be reset since you don't have K layer, and try to gaining them will reset _Celebration Ends_ challenges and _Hyper Beacons_. Do all _Celebration Ends_ challenges you can do and buy all _Hyper Beacons_ you could buy. After doing these, open China and Isreal, then go to Gemini layer and enter _Stellar Dome_. You need to enhance both power hard, keep them full, so that you may gain a ^1.20 boost to Star & Moon Points gain which is massive. If you do these step quickly it shouldn't be very hard for you to reach the goal.

Awaking Gemini layers may bring the fewest new things in AW mechanic: It only brings you _Stellar Dome_, whose mechanic likes bicycle pumps. If you want to get the boost of _Stellar Dome_, you need to click quickly to let Star/Moon Power bar full. However, the ^1.20 boost to Star & Moon Points gain is so powerful that it will boost everything. By _Stellar Dome_ and _Compute Matrix+_ equipment, you will finish Institution row2 Upgrades.

After farming Institution Funds, open France up so that you could reach the 3rd milestone of GE layer. 3x3 Equipment slot brings much more complex equipment strategy. Here's what you should do one by one:

1. _Super Expander_ achievement (a141) and shopping/upgrading new equipments: 9 _Element Capacity++_
2. Institution Funds Farming: 2 _Compute Matrix++_ and 3 _Enjoyment Puzzle++_
3. Memory pushing: 1 _Genesis Overload_, 1 _NE Syngrey Booster_ and 3 _Enjoyment Puzzle++_

After farming Institution Funds, you could buy _The Silk Road_ (I41) and _Energy Modernization_ (I46) Institution Upgrades by respec I Upgrades. If so, buy I46 first to farm more Funds, then respec and buy I41 to do memory pushing, that should push you to the 8th Core and you can awake K layer. Although _Stellar Dome_ can help you awake K layer much easier, it's still not that easy: You need to do some Kc3.
### 14.2 Awake Knife layer first
Because of the same reason of awaking Red layer, awaking Knife layer first is **NOT** recommended. The process of awaking Knife layer has low fault tolerance. If you choose to awake Knife layer first, remember the key to success is to finish Kc3x1.

Before entering Knife layer awaking, open all sites except France/Russia permanently. During the awaking process, you need to switch China/Isreal frequently.

When entering Knife layer awaking, take a glance at your Fragments first. If you can't reach e4100, you have zero possibility to success.

**DO NOT TOUCH LC** since it will reset almost everything you got. **DO NOT TOUCH RC13 (_Crazy Lab_) EITHER** since it will reset your research point which is one of few things you could bring into awaking process.

To awake Knife layer successfully, you need to do these steps quickly and without any mistakes:

1. Do Rc10~Rc13 immediately.
2. Set Institution sites back with China/Isreal on at last. They have been reset by Rc12 (_Happy Reality_). Do not waste too much time here.
3. Buy all _Hyper Beacons_ you chould buy and push _Hyper Scythes_ to 45. You should be able to buy the first column and _Hurtful Steps_ (F72)/_Confusing Steps_ (F92).
4. Do Kc1x1 --> Kc1x2 --> Kc2x1 --> Kc2x2 --> Kc4x1 --> **Kc3x1**
5. Do Kc1x3 --> Kc1x4 --> Kc1x5 --> Kc2x3 --> Kc2x4

By now you should have already got 620 Everflashing Knives. If not, do the extra step below and check if you could reach 620 Knives:

6. Push _Hyper Scythes_, then switch China/Isreal off to do Kc5x1 --> Kc5x2 --> Kc8x1 --> Kc8x2 --> Kc6x1

Finally you awake Knife layer, and this will unlock a new mechanic for Knife layer: _Merge Attachment_ challenges. This mechanic draws lessons from Pair Challenge mechanic of _NG+3_. You will endure two different _Memory Adjustment_ challenges at the same time. What's worse is that there's a global debuff on Fragments and Memories while you completing _Merge Attachment_ more times.

At this stage, author could reach 8 _Merge Attachment_ completion by this order, with proper sites and _Genesis Overload_:
* 13-1 --> 23-1 --> 24-1 --> 53-1 --> 73-1 --> 83-1 --> 73-2 --> 83-2

With 8 _Merge Attachment_ completion, the buff it provide is enough for you to get the 8th Core and you could awake Gemini layer, which is a piece of cake now.

### 14.3 Before 1e10,000 Memories
After G&K layers awaken, you can do more _Merge Attachment_ with the help of more Equipments, more Storm effects and _Stellar Dome_. FO31 would decrease the Memory goal of _Merge Attachment_ massively, making the 4th column of _Merge Attachment_ possible. Besides, MA78 & MA87 become achievable too. Author could reach 19 _Merge Attachment_ completion by this order, of course you need memory pushing equipment setup and use sites/_Stellar Dome_:
* (Order given in paragraph 14.2) --> 14-1 --> 14-2 --> 24-2 --> 54-1 --> 87-1 --> 78-1 --> 87-2 --> 74-1 --> 84-1 --> 74-2 --> 84-2

If you changed order or farmed more Funds that you bought more Institution Upgrades, you may complete more.

That's not a big problem if you could only complete _Merge Attachment_ around 15 times, that's enough. By using Institution Funds farming equipment setup, I46 upgrade and _Stellar Dome_ you could reach the next Strory Upgrade (_Objective Optimization Algorithm_, S53) and could afford I41 with more Institution upgrades. Finally, combining I41, 5FO, China/Isreal, memory pushing equipment setup and _Stellar Dome_ together, you will reach 1e10000 Memories finally. That's the end of this stage and current endgame.
